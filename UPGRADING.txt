UPGRADING FROM PREVIOUS VERSIONS
================================

Upgrading to 4.0 from 3.9.1
---------------------------
- CSSOM: now CSSRule.setCssText() does not accept errors anymore, only warnings.

- CSSOM: mathematical functions (like sin(), abs(), pow(), etc.) now belong to
  the new MATH_FUNCTION type instead of FUNCTION. If you do your own function
  processing you may have to account for that.

  Any value of the MATH_FUNCTION type can be used to compute values in a calc()
  context. Non-math FUNCTION values can be parsed into a calc() and serialized,
  but cannot be numerically evaluated.

  MATH_FUNCTION values implement the new CSSMathFunctionValue interface.

- CSSOM: the evaluateFunction() method in Evaluator now takes a CSSMathFunctionValue
  argument instead of a CSSFunctionValue.

- The syntax and serialization of hsl, lab, lch, oklab and oklch now behaves
  according to the latest Color Level 4 specification.

- CSSOM: calc() values in color components are now evaluated when building the
  Object Model. In previous versions, calc() was not evaluated in case that
  someone was using it to represent fractions or other representative values,
  but this is very unlikely and does not justify the annoyance of carrying the
  calc().


Upgrading to 3.9.1 from 3.9.0
-----------------------------
- NSAC: on url() values, you should check whether getStringValue() returns null.
  In that case you are dealing with a var() inside url(), and you must retrieve
  the var() using getParameters().


Upgrading to 3.6 from 3.5
-------------------------
 - Color primitives (the values implementing CSSColorValue) that use the RGB
   color model should no longer be cast to RGBColorValue to obtain a RGBAColor.

   Instead, retrieve the color via CSSColorValue.getColor() and then cast it to
   a RGBAColor. The reason: all RGB colors implement the RGBAColor interface,
   regardless of it being specified via rgb() or the color() function, but only
   one of the respective parent primitive values do implement the RGBColorValue
   interface. If you assume that 'RGB' means RGBColorValue, you may experience
   class cast exceptions.


Upgrading to 3.5 from 3.4
-------------------------
 - NSAC only: now all custom properties are handled through
   CSSHandler.lexicalProperty(...).


Upgrading to 3.4 from 3.3
-------------------------
 - The old rgb(a) color functional serialization with commas is now the default
   for conversions to RGB (specified RGB values always kept the original syntax)
   .

 - In CSSColorValue, ColorSpace was renamed to ColorModel. No deprecation step
   this time, as 'ColorSpace' is to be used elsewhere.

 - CSSTypedValue.toRGBColorValue() was deprecated in favor of toRGBColor().

 - Use new CSSColorValue.getColor() to access all colors.

 - New StyleFormattingFactory.createComputedStyleFormattingContext() method
   returns a new DeclarationFormattingContext.

 - Removed method newLine(SimpleWriter) from DeclarationFormattingContext
   interface.

 - NSAC only: new method CSSHandler.lexicalProperty(...). For now, only being
   called for one descriptor from @property rules.


Upgrading to 3.3 from 3.2
-------------------------
 - NSAC only: the 'index' parameter was removed from CSSHandler.property().


Upgrading to 3.2 from 3.1
-------------------------
 - CSSStyleSheet.createStyleRule() now returns a CSSStyleRule.

 - ErrorHandler.linkedSheetError() now takes a CSSStyleSheet interface from
   css4j's 'css' package instead of 'org.w3c.dom.css'.

 - You no longer need to set the ID attribute in the native DOM (although the
   XMLDocumentBuilder was probably doing that for you).

 - Native DOM & DOM4J: now only STYLE elements in the same namespace as the
   document element are used to compute styles.

 - The matching of ":link" and ":visited" was narrowed down (see the Release
   Notes).


Upgrading to 3.1 from 3.0
-------------------------
 - If you process a document that has a remote documentURI (or no documentURI
   set), and that document includes links to sheets with 'file:' or 'jar:' URLs,
   you need to call document.setDocumentURI() to set a 'file:' or 'jar:' URI.
   Otherwise, the sheets won't be processed, and the same applies to BASE href
   attributes.

 - The method ErrorHandler.hasErrors() now returns true if there are I/O errors.
   Those errors were previously considered transient, and therefore weren't
   appearing there.

 - On attribute nodes, getTextContent() now returns the attribute value instead
   of the empty string.

 - ExtendedNamedNodeMap<T>.removeNamedItem() and removeNamedItemNS() methods now
   return a value of the parameterized type (T).

 - DefaultEntityResolver.resolveEntity(DocumentTypeDeclaration) is deprecated
   (probably nobody is using that method).


Upgrading to 3.0 from 2.1
-------------------------
 Three modules were split out from the css4j module in 2.x: tokenproducer,
carte-util and xml-dtd. This should give more flexibility to developers that
only want one of them (or want to use css4j without xml-dtd).

 Now you can use finer-grained modules, but if you used css4j together with DTD
classes, in Maven you now need to specify the xml-dtd module separately, like:

    <dependency>
		<groupId>io.sf.carte</groupId>
		<artifactId>xml-dtd</artifactId>
		<version>${css4j.version}</version>
		<type>jar</type>
		<scope>compile</scope>
		<optional>false</optional>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
		<groupId>io.sf.carte</groupId>
		<artifactId>css4j</artifactId>
		<version>${css4j.version}</version>
		<type>jar</type>
		<scope>compile</scope>
		<optional>false</optional>
    </dependency>

 Then, there are the following API changes that you may need to address:

- CSSOM: moved CSSCanvas, Viewport from 'agent' to 'style.css' package. The old
  interfaces can still be used (they inherit from the new), but are deprecated.

- Moved BooleanCondition, BooleanConditionFactory, MediaFeaturePredicate,
  MediaQueryFactory and MediaQueryHandler from 'parser' to 'style.css' package.
  The reason: 'parser' is supposed to be mostly an implementation package, and
  this move would allow other implementations to exist.

- DOM API: introduced interface 'StringList' and two implementations of it.

- CSSOM: StringList is now used in comment processing instead of List<String>,
  and enablePrecedingComments() was added to AbstractCSSRule.

- CSSOM: removed the clone(AbstractCSSStyleSheet) method from CSSRule interface.
  Use AbstractCSSRule.clone(AbstractCSSStyleSheet) instead.

- CSSOM: method SACErrorHandler.mapError() now takes a CSSRule instead of an
  AbstractCSSRule (to make it more generic and allow other implementations).


Upgrading to 2.1 from 2.0
-------------------------
 The changes in 2.1 vs. 2.0 are mostly about NSAC: a few new lexical types were
added (including one for calc() which in 2.0 was considered a generic function).
New primitive types for the cubic-bezier() and steps() easing functions were
also added.

 Also thanks to an addition to NSAC, setting a custom property to an empty value
is now supported, like "--My-property:;".

 Finally, it adds support for env() computed values by means of an addition to
the StyleDatabase interface.

 Which means that you can handle 2.1 as a drop-in replacement for 2.0 unless you
were either: a) using NSAC directly, b) checking for cubic-bezier() or steps(),
or c) are implementing the StyleDatabase interface.


Upgrading to 2.0 from 1.0
-------------------------
 The 2.0 branch features NSAC 2.0 and a new Object Model Value API; it is not
backwards-compatible with 1.0, but the new 2.0 APIs are more appropriate to deal
with modern CSS.

 NSAC 2.0 no longer inherits from stuff in the org.w3c.css.sac package (provided
by the -not needed anymore- sac.jar file) but is an independent API, with its
methods and features being sort of an hybrid between the old SAC and newer code.
Some interfaces have changed significantly, and the usage of the InputSource
class was reduced and is discouraged (a Reader is being used instead).

 Of course this means that other SAC parsers are not supported, which may seem a
loss of flexibility. However, the other parsers are stuck with CSS2 (or partial
support for CSS3) and weren't really usable for real-world sheets. Without the
need to support other SAC parsers, code can be cleaner and is less error-prone
(other parser projects would be welcome to implement NSAC 2 if they wanted to).

 The new Value API still uses the interface names CSSValue and CSSPrimitiveValue
but adds others like CSSTypedValue. In the end, its usage is somewhat different
to the old (and deprecated) W3C CSSValue API, requiring almost no type casts to
obtain information to make decisions about value handling (type casts are only
required when retrieving the actual encapsulated value). The categorization of
values is different, and the dimension units are shared with NSAC 2.0 from a
common source interface. But some methods have names similar to the old API to
ease the transition (for example I keep getCssValueType() to retrieve the value
category, instead of a more proper getCategory()).

 The extended CSS interfaces in 1.0 ('css' and 'nsac' packages) have now adopted
the names of the interfaces that they were extending, due to the fact that they
are no longer an extension but a full fork. This means that if you are using
interfaces prefixed with 'Extended' or having the '2' suffix from those 'css'
and 'nsac' packages, you need to remove that prefix/suffix to begin the upgrade,
and then use the interfaces from css4j instead of the old W3C ones. Note that
this is only for the CSS interfaces, so the 'Extended'-prefixed interfaces in
the 'doc.dom' package were not changed.

 SAC/NSAC 1.x users need to look closely at the new CSSHandler interface, and to
the changes in LexicalUnit; the rest of the API changes should be easy to apply.
The type identifiers in 2.0 use enumerations instead of integers (CSS unit
identifiers are now separate from type identifiers and are still integer).

 If you are using the CSSValue API, the upgrade is non-trivial and you should
look at the new interfaces. In many cases where you were using the
CSSPrimitiveValue interface, you should be using the new CSSTypedValue, although
sometimes the renewed CSSValue type may be all that you need.

 For example, calls to CSSPrimitiveValue.getRGBColorValue() should be changed to
CSSTypedValue.toRGBColorValue(), but be sure that the type is a COLOR value in
the RGB space before trying to edit the color (and you can use
RGBColorValue.getRGBColorValue() to access the RGBAColor object).

 DOM4J users should be aware that the document factory no longer automatically
loads a default User Agent sheet. This backwards-incompatible change may seem
gratuitous, but the old behaviour has shown to be problematic for users.

 Finally, the source-level compatibility is now for Java SE version 8 instead of
7: be sure that you are able to use Java 8 or higher.
